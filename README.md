Work in progress..

A clock to be displayed permanently at home

It (would) displays the next train (RER B) of the nearby station (hard-coding) along with other useful information
- current Time Paris / Hanoi / Osaka
- Weather

For now it is a simple SPA, I don't know how to make the clock (physically) yet, may be an Rasberry PI + an e-ink displayer will do
